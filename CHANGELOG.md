# Changelog

Older changes are in the git history. Each package's version is `<pkg>/VERSION`. On merge to `main`, CI publishes `bend-kit-<package>@<VERSION>` unless that version is already on the hub.

The kit is in alpha. A breaking change bumps the second number (`0.3.0.0` to `0.4.0.0`). Do not keep a compatibility shim.

When you change `<pkg>.bend` or `effs/`, raise `VERSION` and add a line here for that package.

## Unreleased

- Apache-2.0 license, contributor guide, security policy, and issue templates.
- Local HTTP smokes fail CI. A live fetch failure does not.
